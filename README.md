## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Wen De

I am a mechanical engineer who is deeply fascinated by the world of quantitative finance and machine learning. I am currently pursuing Certificate in Quantitative Finance and expected to be graduated by November 2024. While I'm relatively new to the finance sector, I bring along my solid foundation in engineering mathematics and a genuine enthusiasm for applying my analytical skiils in this new field. My journey so far has been a mixture of academic and practical exploration. I have been very fortunate to delve into Python-based data engineering and machine learning by finding great joy in juggling with large datasets, particularly in time series analysis and model building. I am constantly learning and growing n this space and my Github is a living record of this journey. In this Github, you will find my ongoing adventures in learning and applying techniques to machine learning , deep learning and finance. I am excited to share my progress and collaborate with like-minded individuals who are also navigating this on fascinating intersection of finance and technology. Thank you for stopping by and I look forward to connect and learn together.

- ðŸ§  I'm learning machine learning, deep learning, computational finance, mathematics of financial derivatives.
